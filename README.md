Actually working at [Diamo.com.ar](https://diamo.com.ar), doing fullstack development.

**Motivations**: I am a programmer a short time ago, I have been working since 2019. I was always interested in technology and life itself took care of putting me in this place. Anyway, I'm just passing through. I see this activity as a hobby, not as something I want to do for a lifetime, but as long as I am entertained, I will be immersed in this world. At the end of the day, I always wait for my train, one that navigates the business roads ... But I am patient, I want to catch the one that takes me to the correct station.<br>While I wait, I just do nothing else but prepare.
