<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

I am a versatile developer, with experience in building web platforms.<br>I like accessibility, performance and robust code. In addition, I also like to help and communicate as much as I can. I usually answer questions or solve some issues on GitHub, Stack Overflow or on tech communities because that not only helps others, but also helps me.

<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>

I've experience working in a private company and as a freelancer.
I've spent most of my time as a developer with the following stacks:
- Python, Django, Celery and Heroku (Full-stack)
- Python, Frappe, MariaDB and Docker (Mostly Back-end)
- Typescript, Next.js (React) and Tailwind CSS (Front-end)

In general terms, I have 3 years of experience with the Python ecosystem and 1 with the Typescript one.
