# About me

![me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasvazq/lucasvazq/gh-pages/2020-07-15-235125_1360x768_scrot.png)

Actually working at [Diamo.com.ar][diamo], doing fullstack development.

**Motivations**: I'm a new developer who has been working since 2019. I was always interested in technology and life itself took care of putting me in this place. Anyway, I'm just passing through. I see this activity as a hobby, not as something I want to do for a lifetime, but as long as I am entertained, I will be immersed in this world. At the end of the day, I always wait for my train, one that navigates the business roads ... But I am patient, I want to catch the one that takes me to the correct station.<br>_While I wait, I just do nothing else but prepare._
